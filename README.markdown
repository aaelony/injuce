Injuce - An induction toolkit in Clojure
========================================

This is a small personal project used to better understand Clojure and some classic statistical machine learning algorithms.

Initially, this will just consist of some simple data handling routines and an implementation of stochastic gradient descent.

Set up
------

### Requirements ###

* [Clojure][] - 

* [Incanter][]

[clojure]: http://clojure.org/
[incanter]: http://incanter.org/

## Incanter Script ##

The programs here will be run using the `clj` script that comes with Incanter. This script sets up the classpath for Incanter.

To run a program in this package, call it as follows:

	$ ../incanter/bin/clj FILENAME.clj

where `../incanter` should be replaced with whatever path gets you to your installation of Incanter.

I'll aim to make this easier in the future.
